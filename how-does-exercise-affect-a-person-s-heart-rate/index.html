<p>As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. If you’re very fit, your heart rate is going to be on the lower end (sometimes even lower than 60), because when your heart muscle is stronger, it becomes more efficient, pumping more blood throughout the body with every beat. Physically fit people can deliver a greater volume of blood in a single. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Emerson Villela Carvalho Jr., M.D. What is heart rate? What is the.</p>

<p>You can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. Exercise affects all people differently, specifically a person’s heart rate and blood pressure. At any given exercise intensity level, your bigger, stronger heart can supply the required oxygen at a slower heart rate. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Pin on Athletic Training.</p>

<p>After exercising your heart rate should increase and your blood pressure should decrease (blood pressure association, 2008). A single exercise session may protect the cardiovascular system for two to three hours, the authors postulate.
