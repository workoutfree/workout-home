It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Fermentation is the name given to many different types of anaerobic respiration, which are performed by. There are three stages in the process of transforming glucose to atp: While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct.

<p>Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. When cells break down sugars and other elements to generate energy in the lack of or deprivation of oxygen, it is called anaerobic respiration. This type of respiration is common in most plants and animals, including humans, birds and other mammals. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water.</p>

Respiration and breathing are two different types of processes that occur. Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. It is a less efficient form of respiration than aerobic respiration, as a very low amount of. Respiration &amp; gas exchange.</p>
