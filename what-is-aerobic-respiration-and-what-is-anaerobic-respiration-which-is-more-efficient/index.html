Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. It is less efficient than aerobic respiration because it produces less energy than aerobic respiration. The product of this reaction is lactic acid.

<p>' during this time the lactic acid reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water,. Anaerobic respiration is a mechanism that releases energy from glucose without the need of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen, so it cannot produce atp. Why is aerobic respiration more efficient than anaerobic of food?</p>

<p>It can only break down various sugars and starches. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. Aerobic respiration makes 36 to 38 atp per glucose molecule whereas anaerobic respiration makes only 2 atp per glucose molecule. Hence, it is considered that aerobic respiration is bioenergetically more efficient than anaerobic. Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration 92 ATP yield in aerobic and.</p>

<p>Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. Anaerobic respiration occurs when there is no oxygen present. This is due to the fact that aerobic respiration uses oxygen to complete the process of cellular respiration, while anaerobic respiration does not.

<p>However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. Aerobic respiration is more efficient because it uses oxygen to break down glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids and is the primary method the body produces adenosine triphosphate (atp), which provides energy to the muscles. ' during this time the lactic acid reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water,. The absence of oxygen is what sets fermentation apart from other processes.

<p>During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. The product of this reaction is lactic acid. The difference between aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration is that aerobic respiration calls on the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration does not. Aerobic respiration is more efficient than anaerobic respiration because aerobic respiration yields more energy as compared to anaerobic respiration.

<p>In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. However, in fermentation or anaerobic respiration there is net gain of only 2 molecules of atp from each glucose molecule, which is comparatively much less than that of aerobic respiration.

<p>The mechanism of anaerobic respiration or fermentation is similar to common pathway of aerobic respiration upto glycolysis. Hence, it is considered that aerobic respiration is bioenergetically more efficient than anaerobic. Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is. In total, just 4 atp are produced by the end of anaerobic respiration.

<p>Under anaerobic conditions, the absence of oxygen, pyruvic acid can be routed by the organism into one of three pathways: Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is more efficient than anaerobic respiration because aerobic respiration yields more energy as compared to anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration makes 36 to 38 atp per glucose molecule whereas anaerobic respiration makes only 2 atp per glucose molecule. Why is aerobic respiration more helpful than anaerobic respiration?

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. Anaerobic respiration releases less energy than aerobic respiration but it does this more quickly. In anaerobic respiration yield of atp is only 5 to 6 molecules while in aerobic respiration the yield of atp is. PPT Cellular Respiration PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID.</p>

<p>However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. The absence of oxygen is what sets fermentation apart from other processes. In total, 36 atp are produced by the end of aerobic respiration. Hence, aerobic respiration is more efficient.

<p>Aerobic respiration makes 36 to 38 atp per glucose molecule whereas anaerobic respiration makes only 2 atp per glucose molecule. The yield of atp in aerobic respiration is about 32 to 38 molecules while in anaerobic respiration it is about 5 to 6 molecules which is approximately 6 times less than that of aerobic respiration. In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts. A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. Respiration.</p>
