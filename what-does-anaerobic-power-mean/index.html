Neither system provides sustainable energy for very long. In the simplest terms, anaerobic exercise is any exercise that doesn’t use oxygen as energy. Examples of anaerobic exercise include sprinting and heavy weight lifting. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism.

<p>Anaerobic exercises involve quick bursts of energy and are performed at maximum effort for a short time. Examples of anaerobic exercise include sprinting and heavy weight lifting. The maximal anaerobic power is a trainable variable that is extremely important for a soccer player and can be trained in different ways. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. The Importance of Aerobic and Anaerobic Exercise Studio Element.</p>
