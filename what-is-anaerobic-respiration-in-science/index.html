The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. Anaerobic respiration is a kind of cellular respiration that happens when oxygen is not available. More detailed differences between the two are as follows: Advance science &amp; research , technology.

<p>Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. Anaerobic respiration also produces energy and uses glucose, but it produces less energy and does not. There are many consequences of insufficient oxygen for respiration: KS4 Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration Teaching Resources.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. The first stages of respiration occur in the cytoplasm of cells, but most of the energy released is in the mitochondria. It should not be confused with fermentation, since it the latter does not involve the electron transport chain. This occurs in microorganisms, but is also a temporary response to oxygen.

<p>Sometimes the body cannot supply the muscles with the oxygen it needs to create energy, for example during intense exercise. Anaerobic respiration is a type of respiration that takes place in the absence of oxygen and releases less energy, but more quickly as compared to aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the burning or oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen to release energy (atp). Aerobic, or respiration in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic, or respiration without oxygen. Anaerobic Respiration Fermentation Â· English listening exercise.</p>

Anaerobic respiration refers to the type of respiration that takes place in the absence of oxygen. However, both anaerobic an fermentation occur in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, but it can still provide cells with the energy they need to. Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration nice big picture diagram Anna.</p>

<p>Anaerobic respiration is an oxygen independent respiration process, meaning when oxygen is not present in the environment through this process an organism can produce energy. Remember, respiration is not the same as breathing. However, both anaerobic an fermentation occur in the absence of oxygen. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.

<p>During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. The first stages of respiration occur in the cytoplasm of cells, but most of the energy released is in the mitochondria. Remember, respiration is not the same as breathing. This form of respiration is carried out in bacteria, yeasts, some prokaryotes, and muscle cells. Respiration in Organism for Class 7.</p>

<p>The anaerobic respiration uses other types of chemical elements or even more complex organic structures, through an electron transport chain. The only difference between these two types of respiration is that anaerobic respiration do not need oxygen (nitrite, nitrate etc) while in aerobic respiration, oxygen is absolutely necessary. Respiration is a series of reactions, but this summarises the overall process. Anaerobic respiration is a kind of cellular respiration that happens when oxygen is not available. 6.13 Anaerobic respiration Chapter 6 class 10 science YouTube.</p>
