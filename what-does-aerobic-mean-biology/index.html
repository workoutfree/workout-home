However, an aerobic environment may allow the growth of aerobic microorganisms, whose metabolic activities can influence the corrosion of metal. Biological lipids are a chemically diverse group of organic compounds which are insoluble or poorly. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic process is that in an aerobic process, molecular oxygen occurs inside. ~[ ⇑] respiration is the process of producing cellular energy involving oxygen.

Want to see the full answer? The carbon dioxide is a waste product of aerobic respiration because cells do not need it. Aerobic respiration breaks down glucose and combines the broken down products with oxygen, making water and carbon dioxide.</p>
