Aerobic exercises helps the heart get extra blood with every beat i.e., the heart rate gets reduced with relaxation and during exercise. Physical inactivity is a major health problem worldwide, particularly in developed countries. With endurance training, the amount of blood leaving the heart is increased (cardiac output) and the efficiency of blood flow to the working muscles is improved. Recommendations are presented to maximise physical performance and minimise potential cardiac risks during exercise.
