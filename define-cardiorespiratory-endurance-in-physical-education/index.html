Definition of physical fitness measure your strength, endurance From whyiexercise.com
Explain how physical activity benefits the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscle systems; This means a rapid improvement in cardiorespiratory functions, an increase in physical endurance and, of course, an increase in the ability for faster recovery of the trained muscles. In other words, it can be said that it is the physical ability to maintain aerobic exercise for prolonged period of time. Describe the health and wellness benefits of cardiorespiratory endurance;
