<p>Compared with traditional exercise tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) provides a thorough assessment of exercise integrative physiology involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, and cellular oxidative systems. Support of cardiopulmonary function with mechanical ventilation has traditionally involved intermittent application of positive pressure to the patient's airway. Cardiac cycle is defined as the sequence of events in a complete heartbeat that involve the alternative contraction and relaxation of atria and ventricles in order to pump the blood throughout the body organs.
